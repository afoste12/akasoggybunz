A Repo to house my brand

 Websites
- Akasoggybunz Website: http://akasoggybunz.website Website for more content reguarding my Youtube channel, and other hobbies. Just a Place I use to document my hobbies, intrests, code, electronics, and other stuff.
- Updoots: http://updoots.com Website for saving useful internet sites. Kind of like pintrest, or the bookmark bar on your internet browser. I just needed a better way of organizing websites. This allows you to save them for later, share them as a group, and some more. Still in early development. 
- Updoots Adder: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/updoots-adder/adfejilhcbenglgcdllkakdoppighbkc?hl=en-US Updoots Chrome extension for easily adding website while browsing the web.
- Sparknite: https://sparknite.com Employee onboarding SaaS. Currently a Work in Progress.
